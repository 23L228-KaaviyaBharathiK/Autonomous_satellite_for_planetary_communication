PROJECT : Autonomous satellite for planetary communication


DESCRIPTION :
1. What does it do?
   The satellite serves as a communication relay between a planetary body and Earth. It autonomously transmits data from rovers, relays commands, adjusts its orbit, and manages data traffic based on mission needs.

2. How does it work?
   It navigates autonomously using onboard sensors, relays data from spacecraft to Earth, maintains itself by adjusting components, uses AI for network management, manages power with solar panels, and processes data onboard to reduce bandwidth needs.

3. Benefits:
   *Reduced Latency*: Enables near real-time communication.
   *Efficiency*: Allows continuous data transfer with minimal human intervention.
   *Scalability*: Can support multiple missions.
   *Autonomy*: Reduces workload on Earth-based mission control.
   *Cost-Effective*: Fewer ground stations required.

4. Goal:
   Improve communication for planetary exploration, enable more autonomous deep-space missions, and support future human colonization with robust communication systems.

5. Tools and Technologies:
   *Hardware*: Antennas, solar panels, reaction wheels, star trackers, onboard computers.
   *Software*: RTOS, Spacewire, CCSDS, AI/ML algorithms.
   *Languages*: C/C++, Python, MATLAB, VHDL/Verilog.
   *Simulation Tools*: STK for orbital and communication analysis.
